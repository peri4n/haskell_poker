# A poker simulation entirely written in Haskell

This is a play project to learn programming in [Haskell][2].
It simulates a number of Texas hold'em games to estimate the probability of events, like getting a flush on the flop.

Learning goals:

* How to configure your program?
* How to handle side effects, in this case the source of randomness?
* How to log program state?

## Project setup

The project is setup using [Stack][1].

### Building the program

To build the program, execute:

```
stack build
```


### Running the program

To run the program, execute:

```
stack run
```
